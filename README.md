## üõ°Ô∏è Core Competencies & Technical Focus

### **Cybersecurity**
*   **Offensive Security:** Methodical vulnerability research, reverse engineering, and exploit development. Proficient in simulating advanced persistent threats (APTs) to harden system defenses.
*   **Defensive Architectures:** Designing and implementing secure-by-design systems, including identity and access management (IAM), cryptographic protocols, and network security controls.
*   **Threat Intelligence:** Leveraging data analysis and automation to proactively identify, classify, and respond to emerging threat vectors.

### **Software Engineering & Coding**
*   **Languages:** Proficient in `Python`, `C/C++`, `Go`, `Rust`, `JavaScript/TypeScript`, and `Bash` for building efficient and maintainable software.
*   **Paradigms & Practices:** Expert in algorithm optimization, concurrent programming, and clean code principles. Advocate for Test-Driven Development (TDD) and CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and robustness.
*   **Systems Programming:** Experience in building and contributing to low-latency, high-throughput systems, kernels, and embedded environments.

### **Artificial Intelligence**
*   **Machine Learning Engineering:** End-to-end development of ML pipelines‚Äîfrom data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, validation, and deployment (MLOps).
*   **AI Security (Adversarial ML):** Researching and defending against model evasion, data poisoning, and other attack surfaces unique to intelligent systems.
*   **Generative AI & LLMs:** Exploring the application of large language models for security automation, code analysis, and advanced threat detection.

## üìà Philosophy & Direction

I operate on the principle that true security and intelligence are not add-ons but foundational components of system design. The future of technology lies in the symbiotic relationship between AI and cybersecurity‚Äîwhere AI augments defensive capabilities, and robust security principles safeguard the AI itself. I am continuously exploring this feedback loop, striving to contribute to systems that are not only intelligent but also inherently trustworthy and resilient.
